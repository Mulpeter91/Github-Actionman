# Getting Started with Github Action Workflows

This article gives a brief introduction to the concepts and syntax of github actions. While the 
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) of github actions is comprehensive, the aim of this article is to help avoid those early learning mistakes.

## Context üë®üèº‚Äçüè´

Github actions is a platform to automate developer workflows. It was built to reduce the organisational 
burden attached to large open-source community driven repositories. This burden would manifest in the form 
of hundreds, if not thousands, of contributors, branches, pull requests, merges as well as testing, labelling,
creating release documentation and many other tasks or events.

The purpose of an action is to listen to these events and trigger a workflow in response. For example, if a contributor raises an issue, you
may want to sort it, label it, and assign it automatically. A workflow is a `.yml` or `.yaml` file with a set of 
instructions you define.

While CI/CD is often used to convey its utility, it is just one of many possible workflows you can create to serve
your needs. The examples in this article are simple workflows created merely to introduce some of the basic concepts.

1. [Executing Shell Commands](#example-1)
2. [Accessing environment variables](#example-2)
3. [Calling local composite action](#example-3)
4. [Setting & Passing Variables](#example-4)
5. [Making Web Service Calls](#example-5)

## 1. <a id="example-1"></a>Executing Shell Commands üêö

The first example below is a very basic workflow executing different commands in their native shells. The point of this example 
is to illustrate the role of the `run-on` and `shell` instructions. A workflow refers to all the instructions within the file, 
which is comprised of one or more `jobs`, which in turn is comprised of one or more `steps`.

Each `job` listed within a workflow is executed concurrently on a different github server, but you can choose to host them yourself.
The significance of this means you need to specify which operating system you want your `job` to run on by using the `run-on` keyword.
This can include various versions of windows, macOS, ubuntu or even being self-hosted.

If for example all your steps within a job run powershell commands or scripts, you could specify `run-on: windows-latest` and call it job done as
powershell would be understood by the runners of that operating system. But let's say you needed to run a one off Zshell script in the same job, here the `shell`
keyword can allow you to override the shell of the specified OS by specifying the correct shell language.

Below is an example of 'Hello World' being printed to the console in `powershell`, `bash`, `zshell` and even `python` , which are all being 
run on a `windows` github server. Github also accepts `powershell`, `pwsh` (powershell core) and `cmd` when overriding for Windows commands.
See the code example for more useful information in the comments and follow all links to source file.

[**Workflow**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex1-execute-scripts.yml)
```yaml
name: 1 - Run Hello Worlds scripts              # <- Workflow name.

on:                                             # <- The trigger definition block.
  push:                                         # <- An event to trigger the action, of type push.
    branches: [                                 # <- Target Branches. Accepts an array.
      main,
      another-branch
    ]

jobs:                                           # <- The execution of work block.
  Job-Identifier:                               # <- Job ID. Contains related action steps.
    name: Executing Hello World Script          # <- Job Name.
    runs-on: windows-latest                     # <- Tells the server which OS to run on. Can also be windows, macOS, or even self-hosted.      

    steps:                                      # <- Step definitions.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2               # <- Use keyword selects an action. Actions/ path in github is where common actions are predefined.

      - name: Printing Powershell               # <- Optional step name, but advised.                       
        run: ./Powershell/HelloWorld.ps1        # <- Run keyword executes a command. In this case a powershell script.

      - name: Printing Bash
        shell: bash                             # <- Overrides the default shell language of your specified server. 
        run: ./Bash/HelloWorld.sh

      - name: Printing ZShell
        shell: sh
        run: ./Zshell/HelloWorld.zsh

      - name: Printing Python
        shell: python
        run: exec(open('./Python/HelloWorld.py').read())
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173467514?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Run ./Powershell/HelloWorld.ps1
Hello World from Powershell!

Run ./Bash/HelloWorld.sh
Hello World from Bash!

Run ./Zshell/HelloWorld.zsh
hello world from Zshell!

Run exec(open('./Python/HelloWorld.py').read())
Hello World from Python!
```

## 2. <a id="example-2"></a>Accessing Environment Variables üå±

The following example illustrates how you can read `environment variables`. There are two kinds of variables, 
those provided by github which use protected names and can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables),
and custom variables you can set yourself throughout your workflow.

Another significant feature of the `workflow`, `job` and `step` relationship is how custom variables are scoped. 
Declared variables within the workflow using the keyword `env` follow an access hierarchy and can only be accessed within the element they were defined. Those variables declared at the highest
`workflow` level can be accessed by all `jobs` and `steps`. Variables declared within a `job` can only be used by steps within that job and if
declared inside a `step` they can only be used by that step.

### 2.1 Custom & Protected Environment Variables

In the below workflow example you can see that 3 custom variables are declared at different levels: 
`BEST_PINT`, `BEST_WHISKEY` and `BEST_COCKTAIL`. In the `Print Variables to Script` step a [script](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/Powershell/GithubEnvVariables.ps1) 
is executed to print these variables to the console along with a sample of various set github environment variables.

[**Workflow**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex2-access-variables.yml)
```yaml
name: 2 - Access Github Environment Variables

on:
  push:
    branches: [
        main,
        another-branch
    ]
  pull_request:                                   # <- Pull request trigger. Used in Example 2.2.
    branches: [
        main                                      # <- If any pull request is made to branch 'main'.      
    ]

env:
  BEST_PINT: Guinness                             # <- Custom environment variable declared at workflow level.

jobs:
  #Example 2.1
  Access-Environment-Variables:
    name: Print Github Environment Variables
    runs-on: windows-latest
    env:
      BEST_WHISKEY: Midleton                      # <- Scoped to this job and subsequent steps.         

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Print Variables to Script
        run: ./Powershell/GithubEnvVariables.ps1
        env:
          BEST_COCKTAIL: Whiskey Sour              # <- Scoped to this step only.

      - name: Inspect Environment Variables
        run: env                                   # <- Prints to output the available variables to this step.
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173467512?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
The owner and repository name.
GITHUB_REPOSITORY: 'Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman'

The commit SHA that triggered the workflow.
GITHUB_SHA: '321d557ec2d724d2c6aaf056b14859ea8468051e'

The job id you assigned to the current job.
GITHUB_JOB: 'Job-Identifier-Sample'

A unique number for each workflow run within a repository. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run.
GITHUB_RUN_ID: '1836698654'

An unique number for each time the same workflow is run again. Starts at 1 and increments by 1.
GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER: '18'

The name of the runner executing the job.
RUNNER_NAME: 'GitHub Actions 4'

I love a pint of Guinness with a glass of Midleton and end the night on a Whiskey Sour.
```

A useful command to inspect available environment variables within a step is `run: env`. Notice that the below output does not contain `BEST_COCKTAIL` because it was defined and scoped to the previous step.
```shell
...

APPDATA=C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Roaming
AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR=C:\Program Files\Common Files\AzureCliExtensionDirectory
BEST_PINT=Guinness
BEST_WHISKEY=Midleton
CABAL_DIR=C:\cabal
ChocolateyInstall=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey

...
```

You must remember to use the correct syntax for referencing variables in your target shell. For example, Windows runners would required the format `$env:NAME`
while the Linux runners using bash shell would use `$NAME`.

### 2.2 Specific Event Variables

Most github environment variables will always populate, such as `GITHUB_ACTOR` but some will only be populated during a specific event trigger. In the above
`workflow` example you can see a trigger has been added for `pull_request`. This has been added to show
you some of the variables that will only populate during that event, such as `GITHUB_BASE_REF` and `GITHUB_HEAD_REF`.

[**Workflow**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex2-access-variables.yml)
```yaml
  #Example 2.2
  Pull-Request-Variables:
    name: Obtain variables useful to a pull request
    runs-on: windows-latest
    env:
      var: nothing
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Print Variables for Pull Request     # <- Add a pipe key on the run command to make a multiple.
        run: |
          Write-Host "Actor: $Env:GITHUB_ACTOR"
          Write-Host "Target Branch: $Env:GITHUB_BASE_REF"
          Write-Host "Source Branch: $Env:GITHUB_HEAD_REF"
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5198208204?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Actor: Mulpeter91
Target Branch: main
Source Branch: pull-request-ex
```

### 2.3 Accessing Event Metadata

Another variable worth noting and is heavily effected by the action event type is `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`. This variable contains the directory 
within your runner to a temporarily stored `event.json` file. This file contains substantial metadata regarding the specific event triggered 
within the workflow and can be fed into a json object for easy access to specific data nodes.

Every event type has it's own structured version of the file. So what exists in a `pull_request`:`event.json` will not exactly match the
nodes in a `push`:`event.json`.

[**Workflow**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex2-access-variables.yml)
```yaml
#Example 2.3   
- name: Print Json from Action Event File
  run: ./PowershellEventFile.ps1
```
[**File**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/Powershell/GithubEventFile.ps1)
```shell
"Event metadata file path: $Env:GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`n"
"File Contents:"
$EVENT_FILE = Get-Content -Path $Env:GITHUB_EVENT_PATH
Write-Host $EVENT_FILE

$EVENT_JSON = $EVENT_FILE | ConvertFrom-Json
"`nSample selectors"
Write-Host "OBJECT.head_commit.author.username:" $EVENT_JSON.head_commit.author.username
Write-Host "OBJECT.head_commit.url:" $EVENT_JSON.head_commit.url
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5219495371?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Event metadata file path: D:\a\_temp\_github_workflow\event.json
File Contents: (see above console link)

Sample selectors
OBJECT.head_commit.author.username: Mulpeter91
OBJECT.head_commit.url: https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/commit/443da01e18050bd8912d3fac24a86f0c340a2ea8

## 3. <a id="example-3"></a>Calling local Composite Action ‚öôÔ∏è

[Composite actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action) 
are a specific type of workflow file which are designed to abstract out and reuse a set of instructions for one or more requesting workflows.
They are typically stored in their own repositories, such as [Github's own shared actions](https://github.com/actions) 
or [Google's integration actions](https://github.com/google-github-actions), but they can also be stored and executed in the same repository.

A step utilises the `uses` keyword when executing a `composite action`. In the below example you will notice two steps
each using a composite action. The first is using github's shared `actions/checkout@v2` and the other is using our local `composite action`.

Composite actions depend on targeted releases to know which version of the code to execute. In the case of `checkout@v2` this is referencing release `v2`
in the `checkout` repository. You need to checkout your code in order to build it, test it or in our case execute composite actions.

[**Workflow**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex3-composite-action.yml)
```yaml
name: 3 - Running a local Composite Action

on:
  push:
    branches: [
        main,
        another-branch
    ]

jobs:
  Run-Composite-Action:
    name: Print message from another action
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2                 # <- Required to checkout your code in order to access composite actions from with the repo
      
      - name: Use hello world composite action
        uses: ./.github/actions/hello-world       # <- Use keyword for calling other actions
```

The `composite action` file requires a `name` and `description` field with an optional `author` field.
The run also needs to add `using: 'composite'` before executing its steps.

[**Composite Action**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/actions/hello-world/action.yml)
```yaml
name: Print Hello World
description: Prints a Hello World message.
author: Robert Mulpeter @Mulpeter91

runs:
  using: "composite"                # <- Required declaration of a composite action.
  steps:
    - run: Write-Host "Hello World from Composite Action!"
      shell: pwsh
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173467513?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Run ./.github/actions/hello-world
Run Write-Host "Hello World from Composite Action!"
Hello World from Composite Action!
```

Another important point regarding `composite actions` is that they must be defined inside a file called either
`action.yml` or `action.yaml`. It is recommended that if you have multiple composite actions in the same repo
that you house them in their own directories within the `.github` directory. While these directories can contain other
files such as docker files, they must contain **one** `action` file. See working [repo](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/tree/main/.github/actions)
for an example.

<br>
<br>

## 4. <a id="example-4"></a>Setting and Passing Variables ü§æ

The below `step` examples are all run on the same `workflow` file and combine parts of the previous code with
the added fun of setting variables from outside the `yml` file and passing variables around the workflow.

### 4.1 Passing Parameters to Composite Action

In the below example we are using a `composite action` much like example 3 but with `input` parameters. 
The `step` passing these named parameters to the action with the `with` keyword and `<variable>` name, in this case 'message'.

[**Job 1 / Step 1**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex4-passing-variables.yml)
```yaml
jobs:
  Create-Variables:
    name: Creating and passing variables
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
      #Example 4.1
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Use print message composite action
        uses: ./.github/actions/print-message
        with:                                 # <- With keyword to signify parameters
          message: "Cobra Kai never dies"     # <- Named parameter in the called action.
```
The composite action lists its parameters with the `inputs` keyword. Parameters can be `required: true` or `false`, include
a `description` and a `default` value if no value is passed. In our case, a `message` value is sent but a `version` value is not.

[**Composite Action**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/actions/print-message/action.yml)
```yaml
name: Print Parameters
description: Prints a message passed from the workflow.
author: Robert Mulpeter @Mulpeter91

inputs:       # <- keyword for defining action parameters.     
  message:
    required: true
    description: "The message to be printed"
  version:
    required: false
    description: "The version."
    default: "ü§üüèª"

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: Write-Host ${{ inputs.message }} ${{ inputs.version }}
      shell: pwsh
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173627256?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Run ./.github/actions/print-message
Run Write-Host Cobra Kai never dies ü§üüèª
Cobra Kai never dies ü§üüèª
```

### 4.2 Set Variables from Environment File

The following example combines a parameterised composite action with reading the contents of an 
`.env` file into the environment variables for access by the workflow.

[**Job 1 / Step 2**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex4-passing-variables.yml)
```yaml
#Example 4.2
- name: Set variables from environment file
  uses: ./.github/actions/read-env-file
  with:
    filePath: ./.github/variables/variables.env
```
Using `>> $Env:GITHUB_ENV` instructs github to read the variable into the environment variable dictionary.

[**Composite Action**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/actions/read-env-file/action.yml)
```yaml
name: Read Env Variables from file
description: Reads environment variables from a passed .env file.
author: Robert Mulpeter @Mulpeter91

inputs:
  filePath:
    required: true
    description: "File path to variable file."
    default: ./.github/variables*

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: |
        Get-Content ${{ inputs.filePath }} >> $Env:GITHUB_ENV   # <- Adding directly $Env:GITHUB_ENV saves at the workflow level
      shell: pwsh
```

It is advised to keep all variable related files within the `.github` directory.

[**Input File**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/variables/variables.env)
```shell
DOJO_1=Miyagi-Do Karate
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173627256?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Run Get-Content ./Powershell/Variables.ps1 >> $Env:GITHUB_ENV
  Get-Content ./Powershell/Variables.ps1 >> $Env:GITHUB_ENV
  shell: C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.EXE -command ". '{0}'"
  env:
    DOJO_1: Miyagi-Do Karate
```

### 4.3 Set Variables from Powershell File

The following example achieves the same outcome of example 4.2 but adds environment variables
by executing a `powershell` script directly in the workflow step.

[**Job 1 / Step 3**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex4-passing-variables.yml)
```yaml
#Example 4.3
- name: Set variables from powershell file
  run: Get-Content ./Powershell/Variables.ps1 >> $Env:GITHUB_ENV   
```
[**Input File**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/Powershell/Variables.ps1)
```shell
DOJO_2=Eagle Fang Karate
DOJO_3=Cobra-Kai Karate
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173627256?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Run Get-Content ./Powershell/Variables.ps1 >> $Env:GITHUB_ENV
```

### 4.4 Set Variables from Local Step Variable 

The below example takes a local environment variable declared in the step and reads it directly into
the github environment dictionary.

[**Job 1 / Step 4**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex4-passing-variables.yml)
```yaml
#Example 4.4
- name: Set local step variable to environment variable
  run: |
    echo "WORKFLOW_VARIABLE=$(echo ${LOCAL_VARIABLE})" >> $Env:GITHUB_ENV
  env:
    LOCAL_VARIABLE: Karate Kid

- name: Inspect Environment Variables
  run: env
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173627256?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Work in Progress
```

### 4.5 Pass Variable to Dependant Job

Work in Progress

We previously noted that `jobs` are run concurrently by default and that variables are scoped to 
the element they are defined in. The following example illustrates how you can enforce a dependency between jobs 
to have them run consecutively to each other by using the `needs` array and pass a variable from the initial 
job to the `dependent job` by using the `xxx` keyword.

[**Job 2 / Step 1**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex4-passing-variables.yml)
```yaml
Obtain-Variables:
  needs: [Create-Variables]       # <- Jobs run concurrently by default. The 'needs' keyword sets dependant jobs.
  name: Reading previous variables
  runs-on: windows-latest

  steps:
    - name: Inspect Environment Variables
      run: env
```
[**Console Output**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/runs/5173627256?check_suite_focus=true)
```shell
Work in Progress
```

## 5. Web Requests

The below workflow demonstrates a series of simple web calls to the [Github Api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls)
`pulls` endpoint, which returns information  on pull requests. You can feed the response into a json object to access
relevant data. The below `Invoke-WebRequest` calls will work because this repo is public. If private you will need to 
[create](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) 
an OAuth `Personal Access Token` to the header with `-Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer <token>"}`. If the repository belongs to
an organisation to which you are a member you will need authorize that created token to enable access via `configure SSO`.

[**Workflow**](https://github.com/Mulpeter91/Github-Actionman/blob/main/.github/workflows/ex5-web-requests.yml)
```yaml
